# intellij-gpt

A bit of an experiment using the GPT API to augment IntelliJ with code generation and in-line explanation capability. Provide API key in settings. Actions are provided in the context menu on the text editor.

## codegen

Simply write a text prompt into the editor, select and right click the text and select "Convert to Code" from the context menu.

## explain

Select any code in the editor, then right click and select "Explain this code" from the context menu.
